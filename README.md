The authorities in Beijing, China have issued a second red alert for the air pollution several days ago. Although the alert has been cleared, the whole city is still under the cloak of a toxic shroud. Most of the residents are living with masks now to earn longer lives in such an environment.

Putting on the coat, wearing backpack, taking all the belongs needed in school, especially the respirator which becomes the most important bare necessity in today’s life, 6-year-old Geng Hao could finish this complex and boring routine in just few seconds before leaving home. Being more familiar than familiar, he could get all these preparations for a new day well done without thinking or mother’s reminding.

“I’ve seen far more grey sky than blue in my whole life,” said Geng, who is forced to stay at home because of the pollution. The boy described the thing in an exaggerated way, however, the fact that how negative the air condition is has not been distorted. Geng also told me today’s Beijing is just like everyone who lives in it, wearing a mask. The only difference between the city and its residences is the mask the former wears is made of smog while the latter is made of other materials.

What’s going on here
-------------
On Friday, 18 December, the skies was blue and pollution levels were very low for Beijing standards in the very beginning, according to BBC. But several hours later, the winds dropped and pollution levels rose steadily. In the following day, the pollution red alert was issued and residents were encouraged to stay indoors.

“To tell you the truth, the pollution several days ago were much worse than today,” said Ji Hong, a mother of a child who is studying abroad,“ but the authorities hadn’t issue any alert.” According to the Guardian, Beijing pollution had actually been much worse before 18 December, with the government issuing less severe warnings or none at all. It was released by the authorities that although the levels of pollution had reached the hazardous standard, the times of the particular pollution measured were not enough and the final result couldn’t count.

PM2.5, according to China National Committee for Terms in Sciences and Technologies, is a type of pollution involving fine particles less than 2.5 microns (0.0025mm) in diameter. A build-up of PM2.5 in the lungs has been associated with causing respiratory illnesses and lung damage. The World Health Organization also considers PM2.5 readings of 25 micrograms per cubic meter as the maximum safe level. Nowadays, as the smog days become more and more common in Beijingers life, the Beijing authorities have instituted four-tiers alert system  to announce how serious the particular pollution is. The red alert is the highest of the alert system.

The alert addressed this time is the second pollution red alert in Beijing, which is just little more than a week after the first ever such warning. The red alert wasn’t cleared until 25 December, although the visibility was still very low due to the haze.

Why smog here
-------------

> Several points that may contributes to the severe pollution have been addressed. 

> - The major contributors to the smog are coal-powered industries and heating systems, which is heavily used during the winter. 
> - Besides, the problem is also blamed on the booming number of cars.
> - In addition, Beijing’s geography worsens the problem because the city is surrounding by mountains that trap the smog and block the wind on three sides, which is adverse to the diffusion of the harmful gas.
> - What’s more, the trees, which benefit the environment and protect Beijing from the sand-storm weather in spring a lot, are now also being considered as the culprit to the lack of strong winds in winter.

What has been done

Beijing authorities released driving restrictions during the city’s pollution red alert.

The drivers could face a total of RMB 100 yuan in fines for breaking driving.

Except forcing cars off the road, the authorities also ordered more than 2,000 factories in polluting industries to [suspend work](http://en.people.cn/n/2015/1201/c90000-8983810.html), according to CNN. Besides, the Mirror reports that the schools have been ordered to halt all outdoor activities. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Education also suggest all the Primary and Secondary to suspend classes.

When it comes to residents themselves, it seems all the protection measures are only wearing the respirator and trying best to cover their faces tightly. “The smog is just like toxic gas. I never had a sore throat before, but since last year my throat’s been hurting when I speak more.”said Jia Xiaojiang, a 30-year-old cook in Beijing.

“My kid got mild pneumonia thanks to the smog. She has been sick for more than 20 days,” Tian Liping, who works as a freelancer, told the reporter of CNN, “ And the hospital is filled with children with respiratory infections or fevers.” Nowadays, many of the parents in Beijing have the same trouble like Tian. Some of them begin to [buy fresh air from Canada](http://youtu.be/LbIevNlt-JE).

Coping with the problem is a long-term process. The same thing taken place in London last century is never an overnight success. Both the government and the citizens should take responsibilities for this problem and deal with it with consciousness.
